**Background (no code needed, external waits):**
- W7 Kill Gusto — run parallel Wave payroll cycle, then ops decision
- I4 GBP OAuth — monitor Google API Console approval

## 🐛 UX BUGS (Pre-existing, open)

### UX-BUG-004: Left Nav — Auto-Scroll on Group Expand at Bottom of Panel
Expanded items render below viewport. **Fix:** `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` on last item of expanded group. **Size:** ~1 hr.

### UX-BUG-005: "Team" Nav Group — Rename to Better Reflect Contents
Contains Service Catalog + Document Vault. "Team" is misleading. **Fix:** Rename to "Resources" or "Workspace." **Size:** ~15 min.

---

## 🔴 BUGS — Active Crashes & Broken Features


### BUG-026: Forgot Password Email Not Arriving
Forgot password flow exists but email is not arriving. Root cause: INFRA-001 (Resend domain not verified). Also confirm route calls Resend correctly and `FROM_EMAIL` env var is set in production.
**Fix:** Resolve INFRA-001 first. Then add explicit error logging to `src/app/api/auth/forgot-password/route.ts` so failures surface in Vercel logs.
**Size:** ~1 hr. **Priority:** 🔴 Must fix — auth recovery is broken. **Blocked by:** INFRA-001.



## 🔴 MUST — Active Blockers

### W7 — Kill Gusto
Wave AP/payroll fully built and validated. Gate: one successful full payroll cycle through Wave. Gavin is W-2 — do not migrate mid-year. Plan: Arian + future reps are 1099 via dashboard, close Gusto 2026, migrate W-2 to Wave Payroll Jan 2027.
**Action:** Ops decision, no code. ~30 min once gate is cleared.

### INFRA-001: Resend Sending Address — Configure & Verify Domain
All outbound emails (notifications, forgot password, work orders, partner emails, reports) send from `noreply@ghmmarketing.com` (set via `FROM_EMAIL` env var, defaults to that address). This domain **must be verified in the Resend dashboard** for emails to deliver reliably. Without domain verification, Resend falls back to its shared sending pool which is unreliable and may land in spam.
**Current state:** `FROM_EMAIL` env var controls the address; if unset it defaults to `noreply@ghmmarketing.com`. The `FROM_NAME` is hardcoded as `"GHM Marketing"` in `src/lib/email/index.ts`.
**Action required:** (1) Log into Resend dashboard → Domains → Add `ghmmarketing.com` → add the three DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) in your DNS registrar → verify. (2) Confirm `FROM_EMAIL=noreply@ghmmarketing.com` is set in `.env.production`. (3) Send a test notification to confirm delivery. No code changes needed unless you want to change the address.
**Future consideration:** When multi-tenant is live, each tenant may want their own sending domain. `FROM_EMAIL` should eventually be pulled from `TenantConfig` rather than a global env var. Track in FEAT-016 scope.
**Size:** ~30 min DNS + verification. **Priority:** 🔴 Must resolve — email delivery is broken until this is done.

### I4 — Google Business Profile OAuth (external wait)
GBP integration built. App in Testing mode. Gate: Google API Console approval for external app status.
**Action:** Monitor → flip to Published → verify OAuth with real client listing. ~1 hr once approved.

---

## 🔴 UX AUDITS — Must Fix Before External Eyes

### UX-AUDIT-010: Dashboard Role-Switch Layout Flash
Navigating away from `/sales` and returning shows a different dashboard layout on return. Likely two different dashboard components mounting depending on navigation state or session hydration order.
**Direction:** Audit which dashboard component mounts on `/` or `/sales` depending on role and navigation history. Confirm component is stable on return.
**Size:** ~1–2 hrs. **Priority:** 🔴 Fix before external users — inconsistent first impression is a trust issue.

---

### UX-AUDIT-001: Tooltip / Help Text / Hover State Audit (Global)
The dashboard has no consistent tooltip or contextual help layer. Users — especially new admins — encounter unlabeled icons, ambiguous controls, and metric labels with no explanation.
**Scope:** Full global pass. Every icon button, metric card, non-obvious control gets a tooltip or `title` attribute. Focus areas: nav icons, action buttons without labels, score/metric displays (health score, churn risk, impact score, close likelihood), filter controls, audit sections, commission fields. Build shared `<Tooltip>` component if one doesn't exist. Also audit all static help text (empty states, onboarding prompts, section intros) for accuracy and consistency.
**Voice rule:** Tooltip voice = reserved, informational, brief. "Health score reflects GBP engagement, citation accuracy, and ranking position over the last 30 days." Not "Check out your health score!"
**Size:** ~1 session. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### UX-AUDIT-002: Voice Audit — Dashboard UI Copy (Global, SCRVNR Pass)
Dashboard UI contains consumer-facing language that doesn't match the voice of a professional marketing platform. "Upsells available" should be "Additional products available."
**Scope:** All UI copy — page titles, section headers, button labels, column headers, badge labels, empty states, filter labels, card labels, dialog titles, form labels, placeholder text, nav labels, status indicators. Also: demos and promotional materials (brochures, audit reports, comp sheets, territory map page). Excludes: notifications/alerts, tutorials/guides, contracts.
**Method:** SCRVNR pass. Voice target = reserved, professional, B2B.
**Size:** ~1 session. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### UX-AUDIT-003: Brochure — Visual Design Overhaul (Marketing-Grade)
The brochure represents a marketing company selling marketing services. It currently doesn't look like something a sharp agency would send a prospect.
**Direction:** Modern layout — strong typographic hierarchy, bold section breaks, purposeful whitespace, brand-consistent color. Not a template — an actual designed piece.
**Dependency:** FEAT-016 (tenant voice/style capture) should ship first so the brochure renders each tenant's brand rather than being GHM-generic.
**Size:** ~1 session structural redesign; additional pass once FEAT-016 is live. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### UX-AUDIT-005: Dark Theme Audit (Global)
Dark mode exists but hasn't been comprehensively audited. Likely issues: hardcoded light colors, insufficient contrast, invisible borders, shadows that don't adapt.
**Scope:** Full global pass in dark mode. Every page and major component. Fix all inconsistencies. Codify dark mode colors in shared token/variable system if not already done.
**Size:** ~1 session. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### UX-AUDIT-006: Responsiveness Audit (Global — Split Screen + Mobile)
No formal responsiveness audit has been run.
**Scope:** Test at 1920px, 1440px, 1280px, 1024px (split screen), 768px (tablet), 375px (mobile). Fix critical breakage at 1024px and 768px. Document 375px issues as future mobile sprint items.
**Size:** ~1 session. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### UX-AUDIT-007: Admin Logo Swap (Productization)
Navbar and login screen logos are hardcoded. New tenants need to replace with their own logo.
**Scope:** `logoUrl` on `TenantConfig`. Upload flow in Settings (admin-only). Navbar + login screen pull from tenant config. Fallback to COVOS default logo.
**Size:** ~2 hrs. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD. **Also see:** FEAT-018 (same item, sequenced for Sprint 17).

### UX-AUDIT-008: Admin First-Run Experience (New Tenant Onboarding Flow — Full Scope)
Current wizard (Sprint 9) is the basic 4-step shell. Full scope: guided path through company profile, team setup, client import, integrations checklist, and "you're live" completion screen.
**Scope:** Steps: (1) Company profile; (2) Team setup (invite users, assign roles); (3) Client import (CSV or PM adapter); (4) Integrations checklist (Wave, GBP, Google Ads — status indicators); (5) Completion screen with suggested next actions. Each step skippable, progress persists. Wizard state per-tenant-per-user. Completion unlocks achievement indicators.
**Size:** ~2 sessions. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD. **Also see:** FEAT-015 (same item).

### UX-AUDIT-009: Psychological / Human Nature UX Audit
Magic moments per archetype are currently accidental. They need to be designed.
**Archetypes:** Admin ("platform came alive"), Sales Rep ("automation did my job"), Manager ("AI just worked").
**Audit direction:** Walk each user flow. Identify 3 most emotionally resonant moments per archetype. Design micro-interactions, state transitions, copy that amplify those moments. Remove friction from the path to each magic moment.
**Output:** `docs/PSYCH_UX_AUDIT.md` with findings + interventions spec, then implementation sprint.
**Size:** ~1 session audit + spec; ~1 session implementation. **Priority:** 🟡 WOULD.

### UX-AUDIT-012: Branding System — Expanded Color Options + Reset/Delete
Current branding tab has a single brand color field. Need three roles: Primary (CTAs), Secondary (supporting UI), Accent (highlights/badges).
**Scope:** Extend `GlobalSettings` with `brandColorPrimary`, `brandColorSecondary`, `brandColorAccent` (nullable). `BrandingTab` UI with three pickers, role descriptions, "not set — using default" indicator, "Reset to defaults" button. CSS custom property injection at root level.
**Size:** ~2 hrs. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD. **Depends on:** BUG-010 Blob provisioning first.

### UX-AUDIT-014: Pipeline Enrich Button — Intent-Aware Enrichment
"Enrich (50)" button enriches leads indiscriminately, wasting API credits on cold/unqualified leads.
**Scope:** Remove flat header button. Replace with: (1) per-lead "Enrich" in lead detail sheet; (2) "Enrich selected" in Bulk Actions dropdown. Add warning when bulk enriching "available" status leads. Existing `handleBatchEnrich` logic unchanged.
**Size:** ~1.5 hrs. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### UX-AUDIT-015: Content Studio Empty States
Content Studio shows generic "no content." Needs context-aware states: (a) no clients have Content Studio active, (b) active but no briefs yet — prompt to generate first.
**Size:** ~30 min. **Priority:** 🟡 WOULD.

---

## 🟠 SHOULD — Features & Productization

### FEAT-015: Admin First-Run Wizard (Full Scope)
See UX-AUDIT-008. Same item — cross-referenced for sprint sequencing. **Sprint target:** 17.

### FEAT-016: Tenant Voice + Visual Style Capture
The system needs to know who each tenant is before brochures, audit reports, and comp sheets can represent them well.
**Scope:** Voice profile schema on TenantConfig (tone, keywords, anti-keywords, sample approved copy). Visual style schema (primaryColor, accentColor, fontFamily, logoUrl). Settings UI for admin to configure. Template renderer reads tenant style when generating all marketing deliverables. Fallback to COVOS defaults.
**Size:** ~1 session. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD — required before UX-AUDIT-003 brochure redesign is meaningful.

### FEAT-017: Brochure + Marketing Collateral Design Overhaul
See UX-AUDIT-003. Depends on FEAT-016 (style capture). Redesign brochure as tenant-branded output. Extend to audit reports and comp sheet.
**Sprint target:** After FEAT-016. ~1 session.

### FEAT-018: Admin Logo Swap
See UX-AUDIT-007. `logoUrl` on TenantConfig, upload UI in Settings, navbar + login pull from tenant config.
**Sprint target:** 17. ~2 hrs.

### FEAT-021: Tenant Logo + Brand Asset Management
Marketing materials currently use generic GHM placeholders. Each tenant needs their own brand applied.
**Scope:** `logoUrl` on TenantConfig. Admin-only upload UI in Settings → Branding. Toggle per material type (brochure, audit PDF, comp sheet, proposal, portal). Materials pull `logoUrl` + toggle state before generating. Fallback to text-only if no logo.
**Relationship:** Depends on FEAT-016 (full style capture); this is a shippable subset.
**Size:** ~1 session. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD. Pairs with FEAT-018.

### ~~FEAT-022: TeamFeed — Multimedia, GIF, and Emoji Support~~ ✅ SHIPPED Sprint 19
TeamFeed is currently text-only. For team communication to actually get used, it needs to feel like Slack.
**Scope:** Emoji picker (emoji-mart) inline in compose box. Emoji reactions per message (store per-message-per-user, aggregate + display below messages). GIF search via Giphy or Tenor API — renders inline in thread. Image/file attachment via drag-drop or click-to-upload (Vercel Blob, depends on BUG-010). Paste-from-clipboard image support. Server limits: images max 8 MB, PNG/JPG/GIF/WebP.
**UX bar:** Everything should feel native and instant. The bar is Slack. If it feels worse than Slack, it's not done.
**Dependencies:** BUG-010 Blob provisioning (for image upload). Giphy/Tenor API key (free tier sufficient).
**Size:** ~2 sessions (emoji + reactions first; GIF + attachment second). **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### ~~FEAT-023: Stock Photo Library Integration~~ ✅ SHIPPED Sprint 19
Content production requires images. Currently no way to source or attach images from within the platform.
**Scope:** Integrate Unsplash, Pexels, and/or Pixabay (all free, permissive licenses). Search interface accessible from Content Studio and any rich text field — keyword search returns photo grid with photographer credit, one-click insert. Automation layer: when AI generates content, system auto-suggests relevant stock image based on topic (keyword extraction → API query → attach top result). Attribution metadata stored with image reference (required for Unsplash compliance).
**Size:** ~1 session (search UI + Unsplash/Pexels); ~1 session (automation layer). **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### ~~FEAT-024: Client Website Audit — Review & Optimization Analysis~~ ✅ SHIPPED Sprint 19
Fast, structured way to audit a client's current site for technical, SEO, UX, and performance issues.
**Scope:** "Audit Website" button on Client detail page (and optionally Lead detail sheet for prospect sites). Pre-populated with `websiteUrl`, editable. Analysis: Page speed / Core Web Vitals (PageSpeed Insights API), meta title/description, heading structure, mobile signal, SSL check, schema markup, broken links (surface-level), image alt tags, canonical tags, sitemap/robots.txt. Output: score per dimension, prioritized issue list (Critical / Recommended / Optional), plain-English summary. Export as branded PDF. Store per-client with timestamp for before/after tracking.
**API dependency:** Google PageSpeed Insights API (free, requires API key in env).
**Size:** ~2 sessions. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

### FEAT-028: Bug Report Status Feedback Loop
Bug and feature submissions currently go into a void from the submitter's perspective. Reports are visible to admin but submitters get no status updates.
**Scope:** When admin updates ticket status (new → acknowledged → in-progress → resolved → won't-fix), the submitter receives an in-app notification (and optionally push if enabled). Lightweight "My Submissions" view for non-admin users to check ticket status without seeing everyone else's. Existing `BugReportsTab` (admin) already has status management — this is the submitter-facing layer only.
**Size:** ~1 hr. **Priority:** 🟠 SHOULD.

---

## 🟡 WOULD — High Value, No Current Blocker

### UX-AUDIT-009: Psychological / Human Nature UX Audit
See full scope above (in SHOULD section — moved here pending pitch/demo timeline decision).

### UX-AUDIT-011: Tasks/Recurring Tasks Nav Placement
Should Tasks live under "Clients" in the left nav rather than as a standalone top-level section? Most task work is client-contextual.
**Direction:** Evaluate (A) keep top-level for cross-client queue management vs. (B) move under Clients with master queue accessible elsewhere. Audit actual usage pattern before committing.
**Size:** ~2 hrs (decision + nav restructure). **Priority:** 🟡 WOULD — low disruption if changed early, high disruption later. Decide before Sprint 20.

### FEAT-011: Full Button / Route / Path / Dependency & Logic Audit
No formal audit of the complete button-to-route-to-handler chain. Stale routes, dead buttons, orphaned handlers accumulate silently.
**Scope:** Enumerate every `<Button>`, `<Link>`, `router.push()`, form `onSubmit`. Map to handler and route. Flag: dead routes, broken routes, duplicate logic, permission gaps, dependency tangles.
**Output:** `docs/ROUTE_AUDIT.md` findings table. Fix critical gaps immediately.
**Note:** Sprint 12 covered security-critical routes. This is the full functional audit.
**Size:** ~1 session audit + doc; ~1 session fix pass. **Priority:** 🟡 WOULD — before first external tenant.

### FEAT-021 subset: Pipeline Filter — Lead Source Filter
`leadSourceId` field (organic/referral/discovery/import) exists in DB, not surfaced in filter bar. Covered by FEAT-025 full scope — can be pulled forward as a standalone quick win if needed.
**Size:** ~1 hr standalone.

---

## 📋 LEGAL / CONTRACTUAL — No Code

### LEGAL-001: Partner Agreement — Restrict Dashboard Use to GHM Business Only
The partner agreement currently does not explicitly prohibit reps from using the GHM dashboard for non-GHM clients or personal purposes. This needs to be locked down.
**Required language (to be drafted):** The dashboard is licensed for use solely in connection with the partner's sales and client management activities conducted on behalf of GHM. Use of the dashboard — including access to client data, marketing tools, pipeline intelligence, or any platform features — for the partner's own clients, third-party clients, or any purpose unrelated to GHM business is strictly prohibited and constitutes a material breach of this agreement.
**Action:** Update `SERVICE_AGREEMENT.md` (or equivalent contract template) with the above restriction. Have legal review if/when this goes to real external partners. No code changes required unless the agreement is auto-generated from a template in the platform.
**Size:** ~30 min (draft language). **Priority:** 🔴 Must resolve before any external partner onboarding.

---

## ⚪ FUTURE — Vision & Scale

### UI-CONST-001: UI/UX Constitution + Professional Design System Saga
The platform needs to be indistinguishable in quality from Xero, Slack, Monday, Linear, or Notion. Right now it uses stock icons, emoji, off-shelf components with default styling, and inconsistent visual language. This initiative establishes the aesthetic truth of the platform and delivers it systematically across every surface.

**What this is:** Not a single sprint. A structured multi-session initiative with three phases per group: (1) Research & Audit — identify what exists and what's wrong, (2) Blueprint — design decisions documented in a UI Constitution, (3) Build — implement from blueprint in grouped batches.

**Scope — every surface:**
- Icons: custom icon set or curated premium set, zero emoji in UI, zero Lucide defaults without intentional selection
- Favicon + app icons: professional multi-resolution favicon, PWA manifest icons, OG images
- Typography: type scale, weight system, line-height, letter-spacing — codified and enforced
- Color system: semantic token layer over raw colors — `color.surface.primary`, `color.interactive.default`, etc. not raw hex scattered through components
- Spacing + layout: 4pt grid enforcement, consistent component padding, page margin standards
- Component library: every button state, every input state, every card, every badge, every modal — designed with intention, not defaulted
- Motion: micro-interactions, loading states, transitions — purposeful not decorative
- Email templates: HTML emails should look as good as Mailchimp's own emails. Currently inline-styled and basic.
- Notification design: in-app notification center visual quality, toast/alert design, empty states
- Tutorial system: illustrated walkthroughs, not just tooltip text
- Every page header, every panel, every sidebar, every empty state

**Structure:**
- Audit sessions cover one group at a time (e.g., "Icon System Audit", "Color Token Audit", "Email Template Audit")
- Each audit produces a Blueprint section of the UI Constitution (`docs/UI_CONSTITUTION.md`)
- Build sessions implement one Blueprint group at a time
- No building without a Blueprint. No Blueprint without an Audit.

**First deliverable before any building:** `docs/UI_CONSTITUTION.md` — our aesthetic truths. What does this platform feel like? Who does it serve? What does every design decision communicate about quality? Answers codified as enforceable standards.

**Questions the Constitution answers:**
- What are our aesthetic truths? (restraint, density, trust-signaling, professional precision)
- What is the emotional register of this platform? (confident, not flashy; clear, not cold)
- What are the rules for every component? (button variants, icon usage, color semantics, motion policy)
- What is explicitly forbidden? (emoji in UI, decorative animation, inconsistent spacing)

**Groups (audit + blueprint + build in sequence):**
1. Foundations — color tokens, type scale, spacing grid, elevation/shadow
2. Icon System — select or commission set, swap all stock/emoji
3. Component Core — buttons, inputs, selects, badges, tags, modals
4. Navigation — sidebar, topbar, breadcrumbs, tabs
5. Data Display — tables, cards, metric tiles, charts
6. Communication — email templates, in-app notifications, toasts, alerts, empty states
7. Content — tutorial system, onboarding illustrations, marketing-facing pages
8. Identity — favicon, OG images, PWA assets, logo usage standards

**Size:** 8+ sessions (audit+blueprint) + 8+ sessions (build). Runs parallel to product sprints.
**Priority:** 🟣 Strategic — prerequisite for White-Label/COVOS, external demo quality, investor readiness.

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
Keyboard navigation first (highest ROI), then screen reader + focus indicators + high contrast. **Size:** ~1–2 weeks full audit + fix pass.

### Mobile-Optimized UX (Beyond Responsive)
Full-screen mobile kanban, touch-optimized lead cards with swipe actions, mobile-specific quick actions. **Size:** ~2–3 sessions.

### Native Mobile Apps (iOS + Android)
React Native + Expo. **Prerequisite:** Security hardening + API documentation complete.

### White-Label / Multi-Agency Productization (Full COVOS)
Self-serve agency onboarding, per-tenant branding, per-tenant billing, tenant admin panel, data isolation audit. Multi-tenant infra is live — this is the full productization layer.
**Prerequisite:** FEAT-016 style capture, FEAT-018 logo swap, Sprint 17 admin first-run, Sprint 18 telemetry.

### ARCH-NOTE-001: Bug Reports + Feature Requests — Enterprise Support Routing
**Architecture note (no code yet):** Bug reports and feature request submissions from tenant users must NOT route to the client-side admin (i.e., whoever is running the COVOS instance). These are platform-level communications and belong in an enterprise support channel owned by COVOS/David. Before building FEAT-028 (submitter feedback loop) or any multi-tenant support tooling, define a support email address and route all bug/feature submissions there instead of — or in addition to — surfacing them in the tenant's admin Settings. The tenant admin should see a filtered, curated view of what's relevant to their instance; platform-level reports go upstream to COVOS support.
**Action needed:** Pick support email (e.g., support@covos.app). Update FEAT-028 spec to reflect routing. Consider whether tenant admins get a read-only filtered view or nothing at all.
