GHM DASHBOARD — SESSION CLOSEOUT
Last commit: e98ad00 (Feb 19, 2026 ~1:00am)
Branch: main, pushed to origin
TypeScript: clean (0 errors)
Vercel: last deploy had edge middleware size issue — FIXED in 7ffb64a (split auth config, catch-all middleware matcher). Current commit e98ad00 not yet deploy-verified.

WHAT JUST SHIPPED:
- BUG-005: Dashboard widget staleness fixed (3-layer: revalidatePath + RefreshOnFocus + useRefetchOnFocus hook)
- BUG-006: Back navigation added to /permissions and /audit pages
- INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md: Full spec with DataForSEO, NAP scraper architecture, report upgrade roadmap, cost projections, BrightLocal phase-out
- STATUS.md: 7 new backlog items across Next Tier and Future Roadmap

WHAT'S READY TO BUILD (priority order from STATUS.md Next Tier):
1. Permission System Phase 4-5 (replace role checks with permission checks app-wide)
2. Commission System end-to-end validation
3. Pipeline Filter UX improvements
4. Content Library → Calendar scheduling
5. Content CTA enforcement in AI prompts
6. Task Pipeline UX Overhaul (needs design discussion first)

WHAT'S READY TO INTEGRATE (from INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md):
1. Ahrefs API (highest value, feeds competitive scan engine)
2. DataForSEO SERP API (rank tracking, eliminates BrightLocal $150/mo)
3. Google Business Profile API (needs agency application)

DEPLOY NOTE:
Commit e98ad00 should deploy clean — the edge middleware fix from 7ffb64a is still in place. Verify on Vercel after push.
