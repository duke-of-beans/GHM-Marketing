## What Website Studio Is

Website Studio is the site build and deployment module of GHM Platform. It turns the product matrix — the opportunity map generated by competitive scans — into live, deployed web properties. It handles everything from capturing a client's visual and voice identity, through scaffolding and building pages, to deploying to Vercel and monitoring what's live.

Website Studio does not produce blog posts or service page content for existing client sites. That's Content Studio. Website Studio produces standalone web properties — pages that extend a client's domain, branded satellites under the client's name, or fully independent brand identities with their own domain and personality.

The distinction matters because the production workflow, the voice model, and the deployment infrastructure are fundamentally different from Content Studio's content queue.

---

## The Three-Tier Site Taxonomy

Every web property built in Website Studio is one of three types. The tier determines the visual DNA source, the voice profile strategy, the deployment architecture, and the client relationship to the property.

### Tier 1 — Site Extension
A set of pages that appear to be part of the client's existing website. Same header, footer, navigation, CSS, fonts, color values — pixel-indistinguishable from what the client's developer built. The pages are hosted on GHM's Vercel infrastructure, served under the client's domain via a CNAME subdirectory or subdomain. The client never touches their WordPress, their hosting, or their existing site in any meaningful way.

**Visual DNA source:** Extracted from the client's live website. The extension pages derive every visual token — colors, fonts, spacing, component structure, header and footer HTML — from the captured DNA file.

**Voice DNA source:** The client's existing website copy. SCRVNR captures the voice already present on their site and applies it to all extension pages. The reader should not be able to detect a difference in tone or personality between the original pages and the extensions.

**Deployment:** GHM Vercel, client's subdomain (e.g., `audi.germanautodoctorsimivalley.com`). Requires one CNAME record from the client. GHM owns the deployment, the infrastructure, and the content.

**Lock-in mechanism:** GHM controls the pages, the hosting, and the content. The client's domain gains SEO value from pages they didn't have to build. Removing GHM means those pages disappear.

**When to use:** When the client has strong domain authority and the goal is to deepen topical coverage under their existing brand and domain. Best for brand/service segmentation on established sites.

---

### Tier 2 — Branded Satellite
A standalone domain that carries the client's brand identity — same logo, same color palette, same name recognition — but lives at a separate URL targeting a different geography or service scope. The client is visibly the same business; the domain is new.

**Visual DNA source:** Extracted from the client's live website, same as Tier 1. The satellite looks like it belongs to the same family as the main site.

**Voice DNA source:** The client's existing website copy, same as Tier 1. Same voice, different stage.

**Deployment:** GHM Vercel, GHM-registered domain (e.g., `germanautodoctorthousandoaks.com`). GHM owns the domain. Client gets a site that looks like theirs; GHM owns the infrastructure.

**Lock-in mechanism:** GHM owns the domain and the deployment. Client can't transfer the satellite without transferring infrastructure ownership.

**When to use:** Geographic expansion — when the client wants to rank in a neighboring city without building a second physical location. Also useful for service-line separation when the business wants distinct URL identity per service category.

---

### Tier 3 — Pure Satellite
A fully independent brand. Separate name, separate domain, separate visual identity, separate voice. The connection to the parent client is commercial (GHM bills the client for it) but invisible to the public. A visitor to the Tier 3 site sees an independent authority site — not a satellite of a local shop.

**Visual DNA source:** Original design for the satellite brand, or optionally sourced from a reference URL if the brand is being modeled on an aesthetic direction. Does not inherit from the parent client's site.

**Voice DNA source:** Built fresh through a SCRVNR intake interview — brand personality, audience relationship, what the brand knows that others don't, what it would never say. Results in a voice profile that is owned by this property alone and has no relationship to the parent client's voice.

**Deployment:** GHM Vercel, GHM-registered domain (e.g., `quattroauthority.com`). GHM owns everything.

**Lock-in mechanism:** Strongest of the three tiers. GHM owns the domain, the brand identity, the content, and the infrastructure. The property's value accrues to GHM's asset base.

**When to use:** When the product matrix identifies a high-intent audience segment with its own search identity — searchers who think of themselves by brand, procedure, specialty, or interest before they think of the business category. The satellite meets them where they already are.

## DNA Lab

DNA Lab is the prerequisite stage for any build. No scaffolding begins until both Visual DNA and Voice DNA are captured and reviewed for the target property. Missing either one is a hard block.

### Visual DNA

**What it captures:**
- Every computed CSS property on: nav, hero, content areas, cards, buttons, CTAs, footer, forms
- Font CDN links (exact URLs, not guesses — stylesheets can reference variables)
- Exact hex color values read from rendered output, not source stylesheets
- Spacing, padding, margin values
- Actual DOM structure of header and footer (copied verbatim)
- Image dimensions and aspect ratios for hero areas
- Animation and transition timing

**Output:** `visual-dna.json` — a structured token file. Every hub extension or satellite page for this property derives its visual character from one source of truth.

**Confidence scoring:** Each extracted token carries a confidence level — high (unambiguous), medium (inferred), low (uncertain, needs human verification). Low-confidence tokens are flagged amber in the DNA Lab UI. The operator reviews and either confirms or corrects.

**For Tier 3:** Visual DNA is not extracted — it's authored. The operator defines the design direction: primary color, accent, font choices, component style. The token file is built manually rather than extracted. Same schema, different source.

### Voice DNA

**What it captures:**
- Reading level and vocabulary density
- Sentence length distribution (mean, variance — burstiness profile)
- Contraction frequency
- Technical specificity level (does the source copy commit to specific numbers, model numbers, failure rates?)
- First-person vs. second-person register
- Trust signal patterns (certifications, tenure, specificity of claims)
- Phrases and constructions native to this voice
- What this voice would never say (negative space — equally important)

**Output:** A SCRVNR voice profile file stored in `clients\[client-slug]\dna\voice-profiles\[property-slug].json`. Every piece of copy produced for this property is processed against this profile before it can advance to review.

**For Tier 1 and Tier 2:** Voice is captured from the client's existing website copy. The extraction points to service pages, about pages, and any long-form copy — not homepage hero text, which is often too sparse to profile accurately.

**For Tier 3:** Voice is built through a structured intake — brand personality definition, audience description, competitive positioning, editorial stance. The intake produces a richer profile than extraction alone because it captures intentional voice rather than whatever voice the client happened to have before GHM.

### Override and Recapture Model

Every captured token — visual or voice — supports the following operations:

**Accept** — take the automated output as-is. System records it as machine-generated with timestamp.

**Override** — manually correct a specific value. Requires a note (not optional — the field is required). The override is saved with timestamp, operator name, original machine value, and the note. Override history is preserved and visible.

**Recapture** — discard current capture and run again, from the same or a different source URL. Requires a note explaining why (site redesigned, wrong source page, etc.).

**Lock** — mark a token as human-reviewed and finalized. Locked tokens are not overwritten by future automated recaptures without explicit unlock and confirmation.

The provenance of every token is visible in the UI — a small indicator shows whether the current value is machine-captured, manually set, or machine-captured then overridden. Override history is one click away.

Repeated overrides on the same token type surface as a system signal: "This value has been manually corrected 4 times — consider updating the capture source or extraction logic."

## SCRVNR Integration

SCRVNR is not optional in Website Studio. It is a hard gate in the build pipeline. Copy cannot advance from composition to review without passing both SCRVNR passes. This is enforced at the system level, not the honor system level.

### The Two Passes

**Pass 1 — AI Detection Defense**
Analyzes copy for statistical patterns associated with LLM output: predictability of word choice (perplexity), sentence length variance (burstiness), known AI-ism phrases, over-use of parallel structure, hedging qualifiers, and specificity deficit. Copy that reads like it was generated rather than written gets flagged at the section level, not the document level — the operator sees exactly which paragraphs failed and why.

**Pass 2 — Voice Alignment**
Compares copy against the active voice profile for this property. Checks reading level, contraction rate, sentence structure patterns, vocabulary density, and presence of voice-native constructions. Flags sections that read like generic copy rather than the defined brand voice.

Both passes must clear before the copy advances. If either fails, the section is highlighted inline with specific failure reasons. The operator rewrites the flagged section and resubmits. The SCRVNR gate re-evaluates only the changed sections on resubmission — not the full document.

### SCRVNR Status Indicator

The page composer shows a persistent SCRVNR status badge. States:

- **Unprocessed** — copy written, SCRVNR not yet run. Grey badge. Submit button disabled.
- **Processing** — running both passes. Badge pulses. Pass 1 and Pass 2 show as sequential progress indicators.
- **Cleared** — both passes above threshold. Green badge. Submit for Review unlocks.
- **Failed** — one or both passes below threshold. Red badge. Flagged sections highlighted inline. Rewrite and resubmit.

### SCRVNR Overrides

Human editorial authority is absolute. An operator can override a SCRVNR failure on a specific section — accepting copy that scored below threshold — but doing so requires a written note explaining the editorial judgment, and the override is recorded in the page's audit trail. Overrides are visible to reviewers. Repeated overrides on the same type of failure surface as a signal that the voice profile may need refinement.

This ensures the gate has teeth without making it a bureaucratic wall. Good editorial judgment can override the machine. The machine records when it does.

## The Build Pipeline

Every web property moves through the same five stages. The pipeline is visible in the Build Queue view.

### Stage 1 — Scaffold
Triggered when an operator initiates a new build from the matrix grid or from the new site flow. The system creates the directory structure and template files for the property — all pages, shared CSS, shared snippets — pre-populated with tokens from the Visual DNA file. The scaffold is a complete, deployable shell with no content. Placeholder text marks every content slot.

Output: A folder structure matching the tier template, ready for content entry.

### Stage 2 — Content Composition
The operator (or a producer with appropriate permissions) works through each page in the page composer. The composer presents the page structure as a section stack — each section is a named block (Hero, Trust Strip, Why Us, Services Grid, FAQ, CTA) with text input fields. The live preview pane renders the actual page HTML in real-time, styled with the client's Visual DNA.

Voice profile is active and visible throughout composition. The composer does not have a formatting toolbar or WYSIWYG controls — copy is written for the template, not designed on the screen.

### Stage 3 — SCRVNR Processing
When the operator marks a page ready, SCRVNR runs both passes automatically. Results returned inline. Operator addresses any failures, resubmits. This loop repeats until the page clears both passes. Cleared pages advance to review. Uncleared pages stay in Stage 3.

### Stage 4 — Review
A reviewer (or the operator themselves, if solo or if the review permission is not separated) reads the full page in the preview pane, checks links, checks image placement, and approves or requests changes. Approved pages advance to Stage 5. Rejected pages return to Stage 2 with review notes attached.

Review permission is configurable — it can be set to require a different user than the composer (enforcing four-eyes on all published content) or left open for solo-operator use.

### Stage 5 — Deploy
One-button Vercel deployment. The system knows which Vercel project this property maps to, pushes the page files, and confirms deployment. DNS and SSL status are checked post-deploy. The domain registry is updated automatically. The matrix cell for this property turns green.

A deployment failure returns to Stage 4 with error output attached. The operator does not need to go to the Vercel dashboard to diagnose — failure details are surfaced in-platform.

---

## Domain Registry Integration

Every property managed by Website Studio has a domain registry entry. The registry stores:

- Domain string
- Tier (1, 2, or 3)
- Client association
- Vercel project ID
- Deploy status (live / in-progress / not started / error)
- Last deployed timestamp
- DNS verification status
- SSL status
- Content staleness flag (configurable threshold — default 90 days since last deploy)
- Gap flag (in matrix, recommended but not built)

The registry is the connective tissue between Website Studio and the rest of the platform. The dashboard reads it for the domains tab. Website Studio writes to it on every deploy action.

---

## Vercel Project Architecture

Each web property is its own Vercel project. Projects are named with a consistent slug: `ghm-[client-slug]-[property-slug]`. Example: `ghm-gad-audi-t1` for the German Auto Doctor Audi Tier 1 extension.

All projects live under a single GHM Vercel account. The platform's Vercel integration is authenticated once at the account level and used for all client deployments. Operators do not need individual Vercel access — deployment is fully mediated by the platform.

## Permission Controls

All Website Studio actions are permission-governed. Default configuration for each role:

**Owner:** Full access — capture DNA, compose, approve, deploy, manage DNS, manage domains.

**Account Manager:** Can view Website Studio, initiate builds, manage composition. Cannot deploy without explicit deploy permission granted by Owner.

**Producer:** Can compose pages and submit for SCRVNR processing. Cannot approve, cannot deploy. Review permission is optional and granted per-client.

Permission toggles at the action level:
- Can capture / recapture DNA
- Can override DNA tokens
- Can compose pages
- Can approve pages for deploy
- Can initiate deployment
- Can manage domain registry entries
- Can view Vercel project settings

Solo operators run as Owner. The permission UI is present but not obtrusive — all toggles default open for single-user setups.
