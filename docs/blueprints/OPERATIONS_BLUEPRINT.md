# GHM Dashboard — Operations Blueprint
# The Complete Gap-Fill Design Document
# Version 1.0 — February 23, 2026
# Author: David Kirsch + Claude

## PREAMBLE: THE OPERATIONAL SHIFT

The overseas team was a human middleware layer: Gavin issued instructions, 
Shakil translated them to Abu, Abu executed (poorly), Gavin did QC (caught 
errors), loop repeated. That entire model is being replaced.

New model:
  Gavin → Strategic intent (enterprise decisions only, visibility via dashboard)
  David → Sole operator (execution, QC, delivery)
  AI    → Force multiplier (content, research, analysis, generation)

The dashboard is not a reporting tool. It is David's operational command center.
Every client workflow — SEO, PPC, GMB, site maintenance, reporting, satellite 
sites — must flow through it. Nothing lives in Basecamp. Nothing lives in email.
Nothing lives in anyone's head.

Design principle: A solo operator with AI assistance must be able to run 6+ 
clients at production quality. That means the system must eliminate cognitive 
load, surface what needs attention, and make the right next action obvious at all 
times.

---

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The dashboard has two operational layers:

LAYER 1 — CLIENT OPERATIONS HUB
  Everything needed to actually do the work for a client.
  Modules: Task Pipeline, SEO Workflow, PPC Workflow, GMB Workflow, 
           Site Health, Content Studio (existing), Reporting

LAYER 2 — CLUSTER / SATELLITE MANAGEMENT
  A new, separate product-tier system for T1/T2/T3 strategy execution.
  Modules: Product Matrix Manager, Cluster Tracker, Site Approval Pipeline,
           Domain Registry

These layers share: Client Profiles, Credentials Vault, Notification system,
and Gavin's visibility view.

---

## MODULE 1: TASK PIPELINE

### What It Is
The operational spine of the whole system. Every piece of work — regardless of 
type — enters as a task and moves through a defined lifecycle. This replaces 
Basecamp threads, email follow-ups, and mental tracking entirely.

### Pipeline Stages
```
BACKLOG → QUEUED → IN PROGRESS → READY FOR REVIEW → APPROVED → DONE
```

- BACKLOG: Known but not yet scheduled. Exists, not acted on.
- QUEUED: Scheduled for action. Has a due date or is "up next."
- IN PROGRESS: David is actively working it.
- READY FOR REVIEW: Work complete, needs QC pass before closing.
- APPROVED: QC passed. Verified live or verified done.
- DONE: Closed. Logged for reporting.

BLOCKED is a cross-stage flag, not a stage. Any task can be blocked 
(waiting on client, waiting on access, waiting on Gavin decision).

### Task Schema
Every task has:
  - id, client, clientId
  - title (concise action statement)
  - description (full context, what needs doing, relevant URLs/notes)
  - type: seo | ppc | gmb | website | content | admin | report | cluster
  - stage: backlog | queued | in_progress | ready_for_review | approved | done
  - priority: critical | high | medium | low
  - blocked: boolean
  - blockedReason: string (if blocked)
  - assignee: david (always, for now — system designed to add others later)
  - dueDate: optional
  - completedAt: optional
  - source: basecamp | manual | system (auto-generated by scans/cron)
  - basecampProject: string (for traceability)
  - basecampThread: string
  - url: primary URL for this task's work
  - checklist: TaskChecklistItem[] (see below)
  - linkedTasks: string[] (task IDs — for dependency chains)
  - notes: string (running log, updated as work progresses)
  - tags: string[]

### Task Checklist System
Each task type has a default checklist template that auto-populates when 
the task is created. The checklist is the QC layer. "Ready for Review" 
cannot be set unless all checklist items are checked.

Example — New Page SEO task auto-checklist:
  [ ] Title tag written and unique (50-60 chars)
  [ ] Meta description written (150-160 chars)
  [ ] H1 present, contains primary keyword
  [ ] All images have alt tags
  [ ] All images converted to WebP
  [ ] Internal links added (minimum 2)
  [ ] Schema markup added (LocalBusiness / Service)
  [ ] Page indexed in GSC (or submitted)
  [ ] PageSpeed score ≥ 70 mobile

Example — GMB Monthly Update task auto-checklist:
  [ ] Post written (using brand voice)
  [ ] Image selected/created
  [ ] Post published to GMB
  [ ] Q&A reviewed
  [ ] New reviews responded to
  [ ] Business info verified current (hours, phone, address)

### Views

KANBAN VIEW (default)
  5 columns (Queued, In Progress, Ready for Review, Approved, Done — 
  Backlog accessible via filter or separate panel)
  Cards show: client color tag, task type icon, title, priority badge, due date
  Drag-and-drop between stages
  Blocked tasks show orange banner
  Filter bar: by client, by type, by priority, by due date

LIST VIEW (secondary)
  Same data in table form. Sortable. Better for "what's everything 
  due this week" type scanning.

FOCUS VIEW (per-client)
  All tasks for one client, in pipeline order.
  Used when doing a "client session" — opening everything for Cerrones 
  and working through it top to bottom.

DAILY QUEUE (homepage widget)
  "What needs to happen today" — surfaced automatically.
  Logic: tasks due today + overdue + highest priority in_progress items.
  Max 7 items shown. Designed to be the first thing David sees each morning.

### Task Generation Sources

MANUAL: David creates task directly.

IMPORT: master-tasks.json or Basecamp crawl results loaded in bulk.

SYSTEM (auto-generated):
  - Competitive scan detects ranking drop → creates SEO task
  - GSC integration detects crawl error → creates site health task
  - GMB calendar: monthly posting date arrives → creates GMB task
  - Client goes 30 days without a completed task → creates "account review" task
  - Report due date (monthly) → creates reporting task automatically

### Recurring Tasks
Some tasks repeat on a schedule. GMB monthly post. Monthly client report. 
Weekly keyword check. These are defined once with a recurrence rule and 
auto-spawn into QUEUED when due. Never manually created again.

Recurrence options: daily | weekly | monthly | custom (every N days)

---

## MODULE 2: SEO WORKFLOW

### What It Is
A structured workflow for all SEO work — new pages, existing page optimization,
technical fixes, link building, keyword tracking. Currently the dashboard has 
Content Studio (content generation) but no workflow around what to do with that 
content before and after it's written.

### SEO Task Types and Their Checklists

NEW PAGE
  Pre-flight:
  [ ] Keyword research completed (primary + 3-5 LSI keywords)
  [ ] Competitor page analyzed
  [ ] Title tag drafted
  [ ] Meta description drafted
  [ ] URL slug set (no stop words, keyword included)
  
  Content:
  [ ] Content generated (Content Studio or manual)
  [ ] Voice profile applied
  [ ] Word count ≥ 800 words
  [ ] H1, H2s structured correctly
  [ ] FAQs section added if applicable
  
  On-Page Technical:
  [ ] All images WebP with alt tags
  [ ] Internal links added (minimum 2)
  [ ] External authoritative links added (minimum 1)
  [ ] Schema markup added
  [ ] Mobile layout verified
  
  Post-Launch:
  [ ] Page submitted to GSC for indexing
  [ ] Page added to sitemap (if manual sitemap)
  [ ] PageSpeed score verified ≥ 70 mobile
  [ ] Live URL confirmed in BrightLocal / rank tracker

EXISTING PAGE OPTIMIZATION
  [ ] Current rankings pulled from rank tracker
  [ ] Title tag reviewed and updated if needed
  [ ] Meta description reviewed and updated
  [ ] Content freshness: date updated, content expanded if thin
  [ ] New internal links added
  [ ] Image alt tags verified
  [ ] Schema reviewed
  [ ] PageSpeed checked
  [ ] GSC coverage verified (not noindex, not blocked)

TECHNICAL SEO FIX
  [ ] Issue identified and documented
  [ ] Root cause confirmed
  [ ] Fix applied
  [ ] Verified in GSC / crawl tool
  [ ] No new issues introduced (re-crawl or recheck)

### Keyword Tracking (Real Implementation)
Currently placeholder data. This is the actual design:

Per client, store:
  - Primary keywords (pulled from BrightLocal, set manually)
  - Tracking source: BrightLocal (existing) or SE Ranking API
  - Tracked URL per keyword
  - Position history (weekly snapshots)
  - Movement alerts: +/- 3 or more positions triggers notification

Dashboard display per client:
  - Top 10 keywords with current position, weekly change, trend sparkline
  - "Opportunities" tab: keywords ranking 11-20 (page 2 — ripe for push)
  - "Losses" tab: keywords that dropped >3 positions this week

Integration path: BrightLocal has an API. Pull rankings weekly via cron.
Store in KeywordRanking table. Display in client profile.

### GSC Integration
Google Search Console has an API. Connect per client using stored OAuth tokens.

Surface in dashboard:
  - Coverage issues (blocked pages, noindex, crawl errors)
  - Indexing status for recently added pages
  - Click/impression trends (weekly)
  - Core Web Vitals issues
  - Mobile usability errors

GSC errors auto-generate a task in QUEUED with type=website, priority=high.
David doesn't need to log into GSC for each client. The dashboard tells him 
when something is wrong.

Connection method: Google Search Console API v1, per-property OAuth tokens 
stored in vault (one token per client domain).

---

## MODULE 3: PPC WORKFLOW

### What It Is
Google Ads management workflow. Currently the overseas team was doing this 
manually and badly. Every PPC activity needs a structured workflow so nothing 
falls through and performance is trackable.

### PPC Account Registry
Each client with PPC has an account record:
  - clientId
  - googleAdsAccountId (MCC sub-account ID)
  - campaigns: Campaign[]
  - monthlyBudget: number
  - billingStatus: active | paused | suspended

This lives in the client profile, extended section.

### Campaign Schema
  - id, name, status (active | paused | draft)
  - type: search | display | call | responsive
  - dailyBudget
  - targetKeywords: string[]
  - negativeKeywords: string[]
  - conversionActions: ConversionAction[]
  - landingPages: string[] (URLs)
  - lastReviewed: date
  - performance: { impressions, clicks, ctr, conversions, costPerConversion, roas }

### PPC Task Types and Checklists

CAMPAIGN SETUP
  [ ] Google Ads account created / MCC access confirmed
  [ ] GA4 property linked
  [ ] GTM container installed on site
  [ ] Conversion actions configured:
      [ ] Form submission

  [ ] Ad copy written (min 3 headlines, 2 descriptions per responsive ad)
  [ ] Call ad created (if applicable)
  [ ] Landing page URL verified and functional
  [ ] Campaign budget set and approved

MONTHLY PPC REVIEW
  [ ] Performance report pulled (Impressions, Clicks, CTR, Conv, CPA, ROAS)
  [ ] Compared to prior month
  [ ] Search terms report reviewed — new negatives added
  [ ] Bid adjustments reviewed (device, location, time of day)
  [ ] Ad copy performance checked — underperforming ads paused
  [ ] Landing page conversion rate checked
  [ ] Budget pacing reviewed (not over/under spending)
  [ ] Quality scores checked — any below 5 flagged
  [ ] New keywords to test identified
  [ ] Report written for client record

NEGATIVE KEYWORD AUDIT
  [ ] Search terms report exported
  [ ] Irrelevant terms identified
  [ ] Negatives added at campaign level
  [ ] Negatives added to shared negative list
  [ ] Confirmed no good terms accidentally excluded

AD CREATIVE REFRESH
  [ ] Current ad performance reviewed
  [ ] New headlines drafted (test 2-3 new angles)
  [ ] New descriptions drafted
  [ ] Updated in Ads interface
  [ ] A/B test configured
  [ ] Reminder set to check performance in 2 weeks

### PPC Performance Panel (per client)
Visible in client profile under "PPC" tab:
  - Active campaigns with status
  - This month vs last month: Spend, Clicks, Conversions, CPA
  - Top performing search terms
  - Wasted spend alert (keywords converting at >3x target CPA)
  - Next scheduled review date

Data source: Google Ads API (Reporting API v14+). Per-client OAuth tokens.
Weekly data pull via cron. Store in PpcSnapshot table.

---

## MODULE 4: GMB WORKFLOW

### What It Is
Google Business Profile management. Monthly posting, Q&A management, 
review responses, business info maintenance. Currently tracked nowhere — 
Gavin caught that Sevcik's had zero GMB activity for 3 months because 
nobody noticed.

### GMB Account Registry (per client)
  - clientId
  - gmbLocationId (from Google Business API)
  - businessName
  - primaryDomain
  - gmbAccountEmail (which Google account manages it)
  - postingSchedule: monthly (default) | biweekly
  - nextPostDue: date (auto-calculated)
  - lastPostDate: date
  - reviewResponseCadence: 48h (respond to all reviews within 48 hours)

### GMB Calendar
A calendar view showing:
  - Each client's next post due date
  - Past posts (click to see content)
  - Review response queue (unresponded reviews shown in red)

If a post date passes with no post, the task auto-escalates to CRITICAL.
This is the "Gavin catching 3-month gap" prevention mechanism.

### GMB Task Types and Checklists

MONTHLY POST
  [ ] Topic selected (seasonal, service spotlight, promotion, tip)
  [ ] Post copy written (150-300 words, includes CTA)
  [ ] Call to action type selected: Book, Call, Learn More, Get Offer
  [ ] Image created or selected (min 720x540px, under 5MB)
  [ ] Post published to GMB
  [ ] Post visible in Google search result verified

REVIEW RESPONSE
  [ ] All new reviews identified (5-star, 4-star, negative)
  [ ] Each review responded to within 48 hours
  [ ] Negative reviews: professional response written, escalated to Gavin if needed
  [ ] Response tone matches brand voice profile

Q&A MANAGEMENT (monthly)
  [ ] New questions checked
  [ ] Responses written for unanswered questions
  [ ] Outdated answers updated if business info changed

BUSINESS INFO AUDIT (quarterly)
  [ ] Business name correct
  [ ] Address correct
  [ ] Phone number correct
  [ ] Hours correct (including holidays)
  [ ] Website URL correct
  [ ] Service areas correct
  [ ] Primary/secondary categories correct
  [ ] Photos: min 10 active, cover photo current

### GMB Performance Panel
  - Post history with engagement metrics (views, clicks)
  - Review count trend (total reviews, avg rating over time)
  - Search impressions from GMB (pulled from Business Profile API)
  - "Days since last post" — prominent, red if >35 days

---

## MODULE 5: SITE HEALTH

### What It Is
A recurring maintenance system for all client WordPress sites. Prevents the 
"site virus," "broken forms," "plugin conflicts," and "PageSpeed failures" 
that filled the Basecamp threads. Maintenance runs on a schedule and generates 
tasks automatically when issues are found.

### Site Registry (per client)
  - clientId
  - domain
  - wpVersion
  - phpVersion
  - hostingProvider
  - lastHealthCheck: date
  - healthScore: 0-100
  - sslExpiry: date
  - alerts: SiteAlert[]

### Health Check Components

WORDPRESS CORE
  - WP version current?
  - Core files modified? (security risk)

PLUGINS
  - Any plugins with available updates?
  - Any plugins with known vulnerabilities (WPScan)?
  - Any inactive plugins installed? (should be deleted)

PHP
  - PHP version current and supported?
  - PHP errors in error log?

PERFORMANCE (PageSpeed API)
  - Mobile score (target: ≥70)
  - Desktop score (target: ≥80)
  - Core Web Vitals: LCP, FID/INP, CLS
  - Issues flagged by PageSpeed

SECURITY
  - SSL certificate valid and not expiring within 30 days
  - Admin URL not at /wp-admin/ (security hardening)
  - Login attempts log (if security plugin installed)
  - Site not on malware blacklist (Google Safe Browsing API)

UPTIME
  - Simple HTTP check: is the site returning 200?
  - Check every 30 minutes via cron
  - If down, alert immediately (push notification / email)

FORMS
  - Contact form test submission monthly
  - Appointment form functional check

### Health Check Schedule
  - Full check: monthly (auto-run, auto-generate tasks for failures)
  - PageSpeed: weekly
  - Uptime: every 30 minutes
  - SSL expiry: checked weekly, alert at 30 days

### Auto-Generated Tasks from Health Checks
  - Plugin update available → task: type=website, "Update plugins — [client]"
  - PHP out of date → task: type=website, priority=high
  - PageSpeed mobile < 60 → task: type=website, priority=high
  - SSL expiring < 30 days → task: type=website, priority=critical
  - Site down → task: type=website, priority=critical, immediate notification
  - Malware detected → task: type=website, priority=critical, notify Gavin

### Site Health Dashboard View
  Per client: health score, last check timestamp, active alerts
  Company-wide: health score grid — all 6 clients, color coded green/yellow/red
  "Needs attention" section: any client with score < 70

---

## MODULE 6: ON-PAGE SEO CHECKLIST WORKFLOW

### What It Is
Every page that goes live gets a structured QC pass. This closes the loop 
between "content generated" and "page is fully optimized." Currently there is 
nothing between Content Studio output and "it's live."

### The Page Lifecycle
```
DRAFT → STAGED → QC → LIVE → INDEXED → TRACKING
```

DRAFT: Content written (Content Studio or manually)
STAGED: Uploaded to WP, not yet public
QC: On-page checklist completed (see below)
LIVE: Published, public
INDEXED: Confirmed in GSC index
TRACKING: Keyword position being tracked

### On-Page QC Checklist (Full)

  [ ] Linked from GMB if applicable (new service post)

### Page Manager View
  Table of all pages across all clients:
  - Client, Page Title, URL, Stage, Checklist % complete, Last Updated
  - Filter by client, by stage, by type (service/blog/location/landing)
  - Click into any page to see/complete its checklist
  - "Unindexed" filter — pages live but not yet confirmed in GSC

---

## MODULE 7: CLIENT MONTHLY REPORT

### What It Is
A client-facing deliverable showing what was done and what moved. The overseas 
team never produced this consistently. Gavin explicitly asked for it (Cerrones 
"SEO/PPC underperforming" thread, Dec 12). Gavin himself needs to see it to 
maintain trust and authority with clients.

### Report Structure
Each monthly report contains:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 sentences, written by AI from data)
   "In [Month], we completed X tasks, published Y pieces of content, 
   and your top keyword [keyword] moved from position N to position M."

2. KEYWORD RANKINGS
   - Top 10 tracked keywords: current position, change from last month
   - Notable wins (entered top 10, hit #1, etc.)
   - Opportunities (page 2 keywords)

3. WORK COMPLETED THIS MONTH
   - All tasks with status=done, grouped by type (SEO / PPC / GMB / Site)
   - Brief description of each item
   - Links to new/updated pages

4. PPC PERFORMANCE (if applicable)
   - Spend, Clicks, Conversions, CPA vs prior month
   - Top performing keywords
   - Changes made

5. GMB ACTIVITY
   - Posts published
   - New reviews received + avg rating
   - Review responses sent

6. SITE HEALTH
   - Any issues resolved
   - Current health score

7. NEXT MONTH PRIORITIES
   - Auto-populated from QUEUED tasks
   - Shows client "here's what's coming"

### Report Generation Flow
  1. David clicks "Generate Report" on client profile
  2. System pulls: completed tasks (this month), keyword snapshots, 
     PPC snapshots, GMB activity, site health log
  3. AI drafts narrative sections (Executive Summary, work descriptions)
  4. David reviews and edits draft (in-dashboard editor)
  5. Export options: PDF (branded) | Email directly to client | 
     Share via Client Portal link

### Report Templates
  FULL: All 7 sections (for active SEO + PPC clients)
  SEO ONLY: Sections 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
  MAINTENANCE: Sections 1, 3, 6, 7 (for site-only clients)

### Delivery
  Reports stored in system permanently.
  Gavin can view all reports for all clients in his visibility panel.
  Optional: auto-send to client email on Nth of each month.

---

## MODULE 8: CLUSTER / SATELLITE SITE MANAGER

### What It Is
The T1/T2/T3 product matrix management system. When a client has a cluster 
strategy (like German Auto Doctor's 10 satellite sites), those sites are a 
product tier — they need their own management layer within the client profile.

### Product Matrix (T1 / T2 / T3)

T1 — FOUNDATION (Core website + GMB + basic SEO)
  Deliverables: Core website, GMB optimization, 10 tracked keywords,
  monthly GMB post, monthly report

T2 — GROWTH (T1 + Content + PPC)
  Deliverables: T1 +, 4 new pages/month, blog program, Google Ads campaign,
  keyword expansion, competitive scan

T3 — DOMINATION (T2 + Cluster Sites)
  Deliverables: T2 +, satellite site network, domain strategy, 
  additional GMBs, content network, market domination approach

Each client profile has: currentTier: T1 | T2 | T3
This auto-configures which modules, workflows, and recurring tasks are active.

### Cluster Registry (T3 clients only)
A cluster is a collection of satellite sites associated with one client.

Cluster Schema:
  - clientId
  - clusterId
  - strategy: dominate_models | dominate_services | dominate_geography | 
              competitor_displacement
  - sites: ClusterSite[]
  - totalDomains: number
  - approvalStatus: draft | submitted | approved | live

ClusterSite Schema:
  - id, domain, url
  - targetKeyword (primary)
  - targetLocation
  - template: doctor_style | review_style | landing_style
  - stage: wireframe | built | submitted | approved | live | tracking
  - approvedBy: string (Gavin)
  - approvedAt: date
  - issues: string[] (items flagged in review)
  - pageCount: number
  - lastUpdated: date

### Cluster Kanban View
  Mirrors the main task pipeline but for sites within a cluster.
  Columns: Draft → Built → In Review → Approved → Live → Tracking
  
  Card shows: domain name, target keyword, template type, issue count
  
  Sites in "In Review" have an issues panel:
    Reviewer adds issue items (e.g., "Wrong car image on services page")
    Each issue is a checkbox — builder resolves, checks off
    "Re-submit" only enabled when all issues cleared
  
  This is exactly the problem with GAD's 10 sites — Abu said "done" with 
  no structured issue tracking. Gavin said "no, not approved" with no 
  formal issue log. This gives both parties a shared, structured review state.

### Site Issue Tracker
When a site is in review, the reviewer (David doing QC, or Gavin if he 
checks in) can add structured issues:

Issue types:
  - CONTENT: Wrong text, placeholder not replaced, voice mismatch
  - IMAGE: Wrong vehicle, irrelevant stock photo, not WebP
  - TECHNICAL: Broken layout, dead links, mobile issue
  - SEO: Missing title tag, wrong city name, no schema
  - BRANDING: Wrong logo, wrong phone, wrong company name

Each issue shows: type badge, description, screenshot (optional), 
resolved: boolean.

"Submit for approval" button is disabled until all issues are resolved.

### Cluster Performance Dashboard
Once sites are live:
  - Ranking for each site's target keyword
  - Traffic (if GSC connected per domain)
  - Click-throughs to main site (UTM tracked)
  - Aggregate cluster performance vs baseline (main site before cluster)

---

## MODULE 9: CREDENTIALS & ACCESS VAULT UI

### What It Is
The vault exists (Oktyv encrypted vault). What's missing is a dashboard UI 
that lets David access and manage credentials without going to the terminal. 
Gavin should NEVER need to touch the vault directly — but he should be able 
to see that credentials exist and are managed.

### Vault UI (Master only)
  Per client: 
    - List of credential types stored (WP, GMB, GSC, Google Ads, etc.)
    - "Reveal" button (shows decrypted value — requires re-auth)
    - "Update" button (replace stored value)
    - Last updated date
    - Health: is the credential still working? (auto-check monthly)

### Credential Types (standardized per client)
  wp_admin_user | wp_admin_pass
  google_ads_account_id | google_ads_oauth_token
  gsc_oauth_token
  gmb_location_id | gmb_account_email
  ga4_property_id
  hosting_provider | hosting_login_url | hosting_user | hosting_pass
  dns_provider | dns_login
  shopmonkey_api_key (GAD specific)
  autoops_api_key (Cerrones specific)

### Gavin's View
  Gavin sees: "Cerrones European — 8 credentials stored" 
  He does NOT see the values. He sees managed status = green checkmark.
  This replaces the "you changed my WP password and didn't tell me" problem.

---

## MODULE 10: GAVIN VISIBILITY PANEL

### What It Is
Gavin is stepping back from operations. He needs a read-only dashboard that 
gives him enterprise-level confidence without requiring him to dig into 
individual tasks.

### What Gavin Sees

COMPANY HEALTH (top-level)
  - Total active clients: 5 (paying) + 1 (non-paying)
  - MRR: $12,000/mo (5 × $2,400)
  - Tasks completed this month: N
  - Tasks overdue: N (if any, shown in red)
  - Clients with alerts: list

PER-CLIENT CARD
  - Client name, tier (T1/T2/T3)
  - Health score (from site health + SEO momentum + task completion rate)
  - Last report delivered: date
  - Next report due: date
  - Open issues: count
  - Recent activity: last 3 completed tasks

PIPELINE SNAPSHOT (read-only Kanban)
  Gavin can see the task pipeline but cannot move cards or edit tasks.
  He can add a comment to any task ("client called about this, FYI").

REPORTS ARCHIVE
  All generated monthly reports, per client, viewable in browser.

ALERTS
  Anything requiring Gavin's decision (not David's execution):
  - Client threatening to cancel
  - Cluster site approval needed
  - New client referred by Arian
  - Revenue/billing anomaly

### What Gavin Does NOT See
  - Credential values (vault)
  - Compensation / commission calculations
  - Lead pipeline (sales, not his domain)
  - System settings

---

## IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

Phase 1 — The Operational Core (Build first, highest leverage)
  1.1 Task Pipeline (Kanban + List + Daily Queue views)
  1.2 Task Checklist Templates (per task type)
  1.3 Import master-tasks.json as seed data
  1.4 Recurring task scheduler
  Priority: Build this in the next session. Everything else runs through it.

Phase 2 — Client Intelligence Feeds (Make the system self-aware)
  2.1 GSC Integration (error auto-detection → tasks)
  2.2 Real Keyword Tracking (BrightLocal API or SE Ranking)
  2.3 Site Health (PageSpeed, SSL, uptime checks)
  2.4 GMB Calendar (post scheduling + overdue alerts)
  Priority: These make the pipeline self-populating. System tells David 
  what to do instead of David remembering.

Phase 3 — PPC Workflow
  3.1 Google Ads API connection per client
  3.2 Campaign registry in client profile
  3.3 PPC performance panel
  3.4 Monthly PPC review task template + checklist
  Priority: 3 of 5 paying clients have PPC. High value.

Phase 4 — Reporting Engine
  4.1 Data aggregation layer (pull from all modules)
  4.2 AI narrative generation (Executive Summary, work descriptions)
  4.3 Report editor (review + edit before sending)
  4.4 PDF export + email delivery
  Priority: First report due end of March. Must exist by then.

Phase 5 — Cluster Manager
  5.1 Product tier assignment (T1/T2/T3) per client
  5.2 Cluster registry
  5.3 Cluster Kanban with site approval workflow
  5.4 Issue tracker on cluster sites
  5.5 Cluster performance panel
  Priority: GAD T3 work is happening now. This formalizes it.

Phase 6 — Vault UI + Gavin Panel
  6.1 Credential vault UI (per client, master-only)
  6.2 Gavin read-only visibility panel
  6.3 Alert routing (Gavin decision items)
  Priority: Nice to have for Gavin onboarding to the dashboard.

## DESIGN LANGUAGE FOR NEW MODULES

Consistent with existing dashboard (Tailwind, shadcn/ui, dark sidebar):

Task cards: white/dark bg, colored left border by type
  seo = blue, ppc = purple, gmb = orange, website = teal, 
  content = green, admin = gray, cluster = red

Priority badges: critical = red filled, high = orange, medium = yellow, low = gray

Stage columns: subtle background differentiation, header shows count

Cluster site cards: domain as title, status badge, issue count in red circle

Health scores: 0-59 red, 60-79 yellow, 80-100 green

Report view: clean print-layout, GHM logo, client name, date range

## QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE BEFORE BUILDING

1. Keyword tracking API: BrightLocal (already in use) vs SE Ranking API 
   vs Ahrefs? BrightLocal is the path of least resistance since it's 
   already the tool.

2. GMB API access: Each client's GMB is in a different Google account 
   (Goldenglovesmarketing@gmail.com for McIlvain, etc.). Need to confirm 
   OAuth token approach per account, or if a single GHM manager account 
   has access to all.

3. Google Ads MCC: Is there a GHM MCC (manager account) that all client 
   ad accounts live under? If yes, single OAuth token covers all clients.
   If no, per-client OAuth needed.

4. Client portal: Gavin's visibility panel — is this the same thing as 
   the "Client Portal" (client-facing) that was disabled? Or are these 
   two separate views? Recommend: Gavin panel = internal read-only view.
   Client portal = separate feature for future (clients check their own 
   dashboard). Don't conflate them.

5. Alaska Ocean Safaris: Confirm with Gavin — is this becoming a paying 
   client or is it a one-time favor? Determines whether it gets a full 
   client record and tier assignment or a "pro bono" label.
