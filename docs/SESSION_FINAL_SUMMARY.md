## 💎 **KEY ALGORITHMS BUILT**

### **1. Qualification Scoring (Discovery)**
```
Base: 50
+ Review count: +20 (100+), +15 (50+), +10 (25+)
+ Rating: +15 (4.5+), +10 (4.0+), +5 (3.5+)
+ Has website: +10
+ Verified: +5
+ Operational: +5
= 0-100 score
```

### **2. Upsell Opportunity Scoring**
```
Base: 50
+ Severity: +30 (critical), +15 (warning)
+ Health impact: +15 (<40), +10 (<60)
+ Pricing model: +5 (monthly)
= 0-100 score (capped)
```

### **3. Task Priority Scoring**
```
Base: 50
+ Category: +20 (technical), +15 (content/on-page)
+ Severity: +25 (critical), +15 (warning)
+ Age: +15 (14+ days), +10 (7-13 days)
+ Client health: +10 (<50), +5 (<70)
= 0-100 → urgent/high/medium/low
```

### **4. Revenue Forecasting**
```
For each month (t):
Projected MRR = Current MRR * (1 + growth_rate)^t
Default growth: 5% if no historical data
Visualized: 3 months historical + 6 months projected
```
