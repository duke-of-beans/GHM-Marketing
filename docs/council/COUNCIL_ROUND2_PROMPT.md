# GHM DASHBOARD — OPERATIONS LAYER ARCHITECTURE COUNCIL
## Second Round Synthesis Prompt
**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Round:** 2 of 2 (Final)

---

## INSTRUCTIONS

You previously provided a first-round synthesis in response to the Universal Briefing Document for the GHM Dashboard Operations Layer Architecture Council. Below are ALL first-round syntheses from every council member, including yours.

Your task: produce a **final synthesis** that:

1. Identifies points of **consensus** across all council members — where multiple syntheses converge on the same recommendation, that signal is strong.
2. Identifies points of **disagreement** — where syntheses diverge, evaluate both positions and either pick a side with reasoning or propose a resolution that incorporates the best of both.
3. Surfaces **blind spots** — things no one (or only one member) addressed that matter for the architecture.
4. Produces a **concrete implementation plan** — not abstract principles, but specific: what tables, what components, what build order, what ships first.
5. Flags any **risks or concerns** that were raised by other members that change or strengthen your original position.

Do NOT simply restate your first-round synthesis. Engage with the other members' ideas. Where someone made a better argument than you did, adopt it. Where you disagree, say why.

The final synthesis should be a document that David can hand to a developer (or himself) and start building from.

## REMINDER: THE SIX QUESTIONS

For reference, these were the questions posed in the original briefing:

1. **Sequencing:** Correct build order for eight modules and five architectural primitives.
2. **Architecture:** How the five load-bearing decisions serve solo operators today and teams tomorrow.
3. **Scope management:** Right scope vs. MVP decomposition.
4. **Risk:** Highest-risk decisions and what must be right from day one.
5. **Integration patterns:** How new modules connect to existing infrastructure without tight coupling.
6. **Solo-to-team scaling:** How each module behaves at 1 / 3 / 10 users.

And the six design constraints (SessionContext is user-scoped, assignment scales from one, alerts are universal, AI scales by role, Gavin's view is the owner template, Daily Queue scales to per-user).

## DELIVERABLE

A final architectural synthesis that incorporates all council perspectives into a unified, actionable implementation plan. Be specific. Name tables, components, phases, and dependencies. Where trade-offs exist, make the call and state why.
