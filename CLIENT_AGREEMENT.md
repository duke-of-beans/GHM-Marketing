## §1 Services

### §1.1 Included Services

The monthly retainer of **$2,400/month** covers all of the following services, with no tiered pricing, add-on fees, or hidden charges:

**Local SEO & Organic Search**
- Satellite site cluster architecture: acquisition, setup, and ongoing management of supporting web properties targeting your market area
- Active rank monitoring and keyword defense across primary and satellite domains
- Backlink building and domain authority development
- Google Business Profile (GBP) optimization, post scheduling, and review monitoring
- Citation health management across major directories (NAP consistency)
- Monthly competitive intelligence reporting with gap analysis

**Paid Search (Google Ads)**
- Standard Google Ads campaign management (search campaigns targeting local service keywords)
- Ad copy creation and ongoing A/B testing
- Bid strategy management and budget pacing to client-approved monthly ad spend
- Monthly performance reporting: spend, impressions, clicks, CTR, conversions, cost-per-conversion
- GHM manages campaigns within your existing Google Ads account or creates a new one in your name; you retain full account ownership at all times
- **Ad spend budget is separate from and in addition to the $2,400 retainer.** Client sets and approves their own monthly ad budget directly with Google; GHM does not hold or pass through ad spend funds.
- Google Ads management is included as part of the all-inclusive retainer. If a client elects not to run paid search, no discount applies — the remaining SEO services retain full value.

**Reporting & Communication**
- Branded monthly performance report delivered digitally (rankings, citations, GBP, Ads performance)
- Access to the GHM client portal for live rank tracking and report history
- Dedicated account representative for ongoing communication
