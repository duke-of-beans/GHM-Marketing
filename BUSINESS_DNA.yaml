notes: |
  Key insight from lead gen build: Paid enrichment services can drastically improve
  lead quality AND enable creation of valuable work orders showing exact path to
  beat competitors. This becomes the sales hook.
  
  One service had $130 lifetime deal - massive ROI if it provides the right data.
  
  Sales team needs simple, interactive dashboard to manage pipeline from lead → won.
  Once won, client moves to Gavin for support (out of sales scope).
  
  Budget-conscious approach: maximize information richness while staying affordable.
  Looking for sweet spot of "best possible intelligence at reasonable cost."
immediate_priorities:
  1: "Draft and post sales rep job ad"

product_vision:
  core_identity: >
    GHM Dashboard is not an SEO tool, a CRM, a billing system, or a project management app.
    It is a unified agency intelligence platform — the single operating environment that
    eliminates context switching entirely. Individual modules are entry points into one
    connected data layer. The product's value lives at the seams between modules, where
    no competitor currently operates.

  design_law: >
    Context never breaks. Every UI decision is evaluated against: "Does this require the
    user to open another tab to complete the thought?" If yes, it is a context break.
    We eliminate them.

  build_philosophy: >
    Use it at GHM. Break it until it is hard to break. Then think about SaaS
    productization. We do not sell until every module works flawlessly.

  competitive_positioning: >
    We do not compete module-by-module against specialists. Pipedrive, FreshBooks,
    ClickUp, Surfer SEO, Webflow — specialists always beat generalists on their own
    turf. We wrap around them. Agencies paying $400-600/month across GoHighLevel +
    ClickUp + Ahrefs + FreshBooks + a website builder. GHM replaces all five.
    The comparison is not feature-by-feature — it is context-break-by-context-break.

  cross_module_flows:
    - "Lead source → invoiced revenue attribution (true channel ROI)"
    - "Task completion → Wave invoice auto-generation"
    - "Website performance → content recommendations → task creation"
    - "Client Health Score: 5-module composite visible everywhere a client appears"
    - "Content → lead capture → conversion and revenue attribution"

  client_health_score: >
    The most important cross-module feature. A single green/yellow/red dot visible
    everywhere a client appears. Inputs: task completion rate, payment timeliness,
    ranking trend, content output rate, communication recency, website health.
    Output: answers "who needs attention today" without clicking anything.

  module_build_order:
    1: "Tasks + Billing (simultaneous) — proves the task→invoice architecture"
    2: "Client Health Score — launches with billing, connective tissue"
    3: "Content Studio — AI differentiator via SEO API integration"
    4: "Lead Generation — pipeline kanban, convert-to-client data carry-through"
    5: "Website Studio — last, most expensive, done once and done right"

notes: |
  GHM Digital Marketing is Gavin's company. David operates as effective COO
  managing all operations, sales team, and strategy. David's compensation is
  $240/mo per client managed, paid to Apex North (his contractor entity) via Wave AP.
  David plans to negotiate increased compensation at 10+ clients based on demonstrated value.

  Gavin receives a salary only — handled entirely outside the dashboard and commission
  engine. SALARY_ONLY_USER_IDS = [4] is enforced in code permanently.

  All client money flows to GHM bank account. Commission engine triggers on Wave
  invoice.paid webhook (primary) and monthly reconciliation cron on the 5th (safety net).
  Pending transactions surface in Approvals tab for David/Gavin to approve before Wave AP
  sends payment to contractor entities.
