notes: |
  Key insight from lead gen build: Paid enrichment services can drastically improve
  lead quality AND enable creation of valuable work orders showing exact path to
  beat competitors. This becomes the sales hook.
  
  One service had $130 lifetime deal - massive ROI if it provides the right data.
  
  Sales team needs simple, interactive dashboard to manage pipeline from lead → won.
  Once won, client moves to Gavin for support (out of sales scope).
  
  Budget-conscious approach: maximize information richness while staying affordable.
  Looking for sweet spot of "best possible intelligence at reasonable cost."
