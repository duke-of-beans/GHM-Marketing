## AUDIT SUMMARY (verbatim from COLOR_AUDIT.md)

**Total hardcoded color classes found:** ~1,229 (1,066 in components + 163 in pages)
**Total inline color values found:** 109 (50 inline styles + 59 hex color references in style objects)
**Total SVG/chart color values found:** 44
**shadcn semantic tokens in use:** Yes — background, foreground, card, popover, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, border, input, ring (full shadcn set)
**Runtime brand injection:** Yes — 3 properties (`--brand-primary`, `--brand-secondary`, `--brand-accent`)
**Dark mode approach:** Hybrid (CSS variables for base layer + `dark:` class variants for hardcoded colors)
**Estimated dark mode coverage:** Few (~16% of hardcoded color usages have dark: variants)

## TOP 5 AREAS OF CONCERN FOR TOKEN MIGRATION
1. **Status/state color systems (12 distinct patterns)** — Health scores, churn risk, task priority, content status, lead stages, competitive intel, financial indicators, bug severity, audit events, upsell priority, territory health, and approval states all use the same green/yellow/orange/red pattern but define colors independently in each component. A unified semantic token system (`color.status.success`, `color.status.warning`, `color.status.danger`, `color.status.info`) would eliminate ~400+ hardcoded class usages.

2. **Chart colors completely bypass the token system** — 44 hardcoded hex values across recharts components. Only 1 of 8 chart components uses CSS variables. All chart colors need to migrate to semantic tokens for dark mode support and brand consistency.

3. **PDF/print pages use a custom navy (#1e3a5f) not in any token system** — This appears to be a GHM brand color that should be formalized as a brand token. These pages also duplicate standard Tailwind colors as hex values because @react-pdf/renderer can't use CSS classes.

4. **Welcome onboarding page is a color-class hotspot** — `welcome/[token]/page.tsx` alone accounts for ~90 text color usages and ~30 bg color usages, almost entirely without dark mode variants. This single file represents ~10% of all hardcoded color usage in the project.

5. **Inconsistent shade usage across the same semantic concept** — "positive/success" is variously `green-500`, `green-600`, `green-700`, `green-800`, `emerald-500`, and `emerald-600` depending on the component. "Warning" is variously `yellow-*`, `amber-*`, and `orange-*`. Standardizing on a single shade per semantic intent would improve visual consistency.

## FILES THAT COULDN'T BE READ OR WERE UNEXPECTEDLY STRUCTURED

None. All target files loaded successfully. No blocking issues encountered.

**Note:** `STATUS.md` is very large (977 lines) and was truncated to the header per blueprint instructions. The full file was not needed for this audit.

## NEXT SESSION PREP

**Next session:** Sprint 23-B — Color Token Design (Chat session, not agent)
**Required input:** `docs/ui-constitution/COLOR_AUDIT.md` ✅ Ready
**Key decisions for Chat session:**
- Define the semantic token architecture (naming convention, hierarchy)
- Decide status color standardization (which shade of green/yellow/red/orange to canonicalize)
- Decide chart color token strategy (CSS variables for recharts?)
- Decide whether `#1e3a5f` custom navy becomes an official brand token
- Plan migration approach: which components migrate first?

## PRE-EXISTING WORKING TREE STATE

32 modified files exist in `git status` from prior sessions. These are NOT from this audit session. The files include schema changes, component updates, and doc updates from recent sprints. Consider a commit/push before starting Sprint 23-B.
