---

### 2. COMMISSION & RESIDUAL TRACKING ✅ APPROVED
**Status:** Spec complete, ready to build  
**Priority:** HIGH (build in parallel with edit)  
**Effort:** 4 weeks (phased rollout)  

**Commission Structure:**
- Sales Rep: $1,000 commission (one-time, first month after signing + payment)
- Sales Rep: $200/mo residual (starting month 2, ongoing)
- Master Manager (David): $240/mo (starting month 1, ongoing)
- Master Manager (Gavin): $0 (owner profit)

**Sales Rep:** Arian Germani (already in system)

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Week 1:** Database schema + payment calculations
2. **Week 2:** Admin configuration UI
3. **Week 3:** Dashboard widgets (rep, master, owner views)
4. **Week 4:** Reporting & notifications

**Spec:** `COMMISSION_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` (637 lines)

---

### 3. LEAD ENRICHMENT ENHANCEMENT ✅ APPROVED
**Status:** Spec complete  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (after commission Phase 1)  
**Effort:** 3-5 days  

**Features:**
- Single lead enrich button (client detail page)
- Batch enrich with multi-select (lead list)
- Duplicate detection (don't pay twice)
- Cost tracking per enrichment
- Warning when lead already enriched

**Deliverable:** Efficient lead enrichment without wasted API costs

---

### 4. WEBSITE BUILD AUTOMATION PIPELINE ✅ APPROVED
**Status:** Architecture confirmed, spec in progress  
**Priority:** HIGH (start after commission phases 1-2)  
**Effort:** 6-7 weeks  

#### CRITICAL TECHNICAL DECISIONS:

**Satellite Site Deployment:** Option B (Vercel + Custom Domains)
- System generates Next.js site
- Auto-deploy to Vercel
- Purchase domain from GoDaddy/similar
- Point DNS to Vercel
- Free SSL, automatic deployments, blazing fast
- GHM owns satellites

**Main Site Extensions:** Option B (Subdomain Approach)
- Extensions deployed to subdomain (e.g., `blog.germanautodoctor.com`)
- Avoids client friction (no WordPress credentials needed)
- Full control over quality
- Modern tech stack
- Client's main site stays untouched
- GHM owns extensions

**Why Subdomains:**
- Avoids "What's your WordPress login?" nightmare
- No waiting weeks for client credentials
- No dealing with forgotten passwords
- No touching their fragile setup
- Just deploy and move on

**Integration Points:**
- SENTRY scouts keywords/topics
- SCRVNR writes content in client voice
- System generates site structure
- Rep initiates builds (fills form)
- David handles custom development

**Workflow:**
1. Rep marks client needs website (product selected)
2. Rep clicks "Start Build" in dashboard
3. System asks template-driven questions:
   - Which template? (Extension vs Satellite)
   - Business details (auto-pulled from client record)
   - Website URL (to analyze main site)
4. System auto-generates:
   - GitHub repo (from template)
   - Vercel project (auto-deploy)
   - Style guide (scraped from main site)
   - Source of Truth documentation
   - Task list for David
5. System flags custom requirements
6. David takes over (4 hours instead of 20 hours)

**Spec:** `COMMISSION_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` contains website pipeline notes

---

### 5. SENTRY INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM ✅ OPTION B CONFIRMED
**Status:** Architecture decided  
**Priority:** MEDIUM (after website pipeline foundations)  
**Effort:** 1 day (simple system)  

**CRITICAL DECISION: Build Simple GHM-Specific System**

**NOT using Gregore SENTRY because:**
- Gregore = 800+ lines, complex pattern detection, learning loops
- GHM needs = 250 lines, simple keyword monitoring
- Gregore = research intelligence (unknown unknowns)
- GHM = task automation (known objectives)

**What GHM SENTRY Does (Simple):**
1. Monitor competitor keywords (Ahrefs API)
   - Find keywords: volume > 100, difficulty < 30
   - Client doesn't rank for them yet
   - Queue top 20 for content

2. Website change detection (basic scraping)
   - Check if competitor added pages
   - Alert when changes detected

3. Industry news (basic RSS)
   - Auto repair industry feeds
   - SEO blog feeds
   - Show in dashboard

4. Content topic queue (for SCRVNR)
   - Send topics to SCRVNR
   - Create tasks for content writing

**Total Complexity:** ~250 lines  
**Dependencies:** Ahrefs SDK, web scraper, RSS parser  
**UI:** Simple table/list, no graphs or timelines

---

### 6. SCRVNR INTEGRATION ✅ EXISTS & READY
**Status:** SCRVNR fully operational at `D:\SCRVNR`  
**Priority:** Integration needed for website pipeline  

**What SCRVNR Is:**
- Voice synthesis system (v1.0.0, production ready)
- Captures David's authentic voice
- 5 environments: DEV, RESEARCH, CAREER, WORK, PERSONAL
- SQLite voice pattern database
- Auto-learning from every output
- Quality gates (7 automated checks)

**GHM Integration Needs:**
1. Create "CLIENT" environment (6th environment)
2. Voice profiling per client (scrape main site for voice)
3. Topic-to-content workflow
4. Quality validation before publish
5. Deploy button (human approval)

**Components:**
```
D:\SCRVNR\
├── core/protocols/          # 8 protocol files
├── environments/            # 5 calibrations (need +1 for clients)
├── learning/voice.db        # Pattern database
├── tools/orchestrator.py    # Python automation
```

## 📊 BUILD PRIORITY MATRIX (Superseded — see updated matrix above §8)

---

---

## Phase 12: Commission System — Transaction Engine ✅

**Session:** Feb 2026
**Status:** Complete — TypeScript clean, zero new errors

### What Was Missing

The commission system had complete schema, calculation engine, 3 payment read APIs, and all dashboard widgets — but no mechanism to actually *create* transactions. Every widget was reading from a table that could never have rows in it.

Three pieces were missing in dependency order:

**1. Monthly cron job** (`src/app/api/cron/generate-payments/route.ts`)
- Runs 1st of every month at 12:01 AM UTC (vercel.json updated)
- Fetches all active clients + compensation configs in two queries
- Idempotency check via Set: skips `clientId-userId-type` combos already created this month
- Generates residuals (salesRepId + config + month eligibility check)
- Generates master fees (masterManagerId + config + non-owner check)
- Batch insert via `createMany` — atomic, safe to re-run
- Returns `{ created, skipped, clientsProcessed, duration }` for observability

**2. CompensationConfigSection wired into TeamManagementTab**
- Component existed but was never mounted
- Added import + `Separator` import to `TeamManagementTab.tsx`
- Mounted below user list, master-role-only, passes active users filtered from existing state
- Admins can now set per-user commission/residual/master-fee config before the cron fires

**3. Commission trigger on client onboard** (clients `[id]/route.ts`)
- Detects `status → "active"` transition in the existing PATCH handler
- Fires a one-time commission transaction for the salesRep immediately
- Idempotency check: skips if a commission already exists for that client (handles re-activation)
- Auto-stamps `onboardedMonth` on ClientProfile if not already set (residual eligibility depends on it)
- Non-fatal: commission failure logs and continues — the client update already succeeded

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/app/api/cron/generate-payments/route.ts` | NEW — monthly payment generation cron |
| `vercel.json` | Added `generate-payments` cron schedule (`1 0 1 * *`) |
| `src/components/settings/TeamManagementTab.tsx` | Mounted `CompensationConfigSection` below user list |
| `src/app/api/clients/[id]/route.ts` | Added commission trigger on status → active transition |

---

### 7. CLIENT ONBOARDING PORTAL ✅ SPEC COMPLETE
**Status:** Full spec with wireframes, data model, task breakdown — ready to build
**Priority:** HIGH (blocks partner launch — partner generates link → client fills form → ops processes)
**Effort:** ~27 hours across 5 phases
**Spec:** `D:\Work\SEO-Services\specs\ONBOARDING_PORTAL_SPEC.md`

**What It Does:**
- Partner generates token-based onboarding link from lead detail page
- Client fills 5-step form (business info, contacts, technical access, market/content, review)
- No login required — UUID token auth, 30-day expiry
- Pre-fills from lead record, auto-saves progress
- Ops receives submission in queue with checklist
- Triggers first invoice on completion

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- New Prisma models: `OnboardingToken`, `OnboardingSubmission`
- Public route group `(onboarding)/welcome/[token]` — no dashboard layout
- Credential security: v1 captures access *method* only, no passwords stored
- Mobile-first (client fills on phone after sales meeting)

**Build Phases:**
1. Foundation (4 hrs): Schema + layout + step wizard shell
2. APIs (5 hrs): Token generation, form load/save/submit
3. Client form (9 hrs): All 5 steps + auto-save + confirmation
4. Dashboard (7.5 hrs): Partner link gen, ops queue, submission detail + checklist
5. Polish (4.5 hrs): Notifications, mobile pass, error handling

---

### 8. WAVE PAYMENTS INTEGRATION ✅ SPEC COMPLETE
**Status:** Full blueprint with wireframes, schema, library arch, task breakdown — ready to build
**Priority:** HIGH (enables automated billing, partner payments, kills Gusto)
**Effort:** ~34 hours across 7 phases
**Spec:** `D:\Work\SEO-Services\specs\WAVE_PAYMENTS_BLUEPRINT.md`
**Audit:** `D:\Work\SEO-Services\specs\CONTRACT_AUDIT_AND_PAYMENTS.md`

**What It Does:**
- Automated monthly client invoicing via Wave GraphQL API
- Payment received → webhook → dashboard updates (health score, payment status)
- Automated payment escalation per contract §3.3 (grace → overdue → pause → collections)
- Partner bills pushed to Wave for contractor direct deposit
- Financial overview dashboard (AR, AP, cash flow, profitability)
- Client billing tab on detail page (invoice history, status, quick actions)
- Enhanced partner earnings with payment history + 1099 YTD
- Replaces Gusto entirely

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Wave GraphQL API (not REST) — create customers, invoices, vendors, bills
- New Prisma model: `InvoiceRecord` (local mirror, avoids hitting Wave on every query)
- Wave fields added to: `PaymentTransaction`, `ClientProfile`, `User`
- Dashboard owns calculation logic; Wave owns money movement + tax compliance
- BofA connects to Wave as funding source — dashboard never touches bank directly
- Webhook-driven: Wave fires events → dashboard reacts

**Build Phases:**
1. W1 — Wave Setup (2 hrs): Manual account config, BofA connection, API credentials
2. W2 — Schema + Library (4 hrs): Prisma changes + `lib/wave/` GraphQL client
3. W3 — Invoice Automation / AR (8 hrs): Monthly invoicing, webhooks, overdue detection
4. W4 — Partner Payments / AP (4 hrs): Bill generation, cron integration, vendor sync
5. W5 — Dashboard UI (12 hrs): Financial overview, billing tab, enhanced earnings
6. W6 — Settings + Polish (3 hrs): Sync status widget, error handling, constants
7. W7 — Kill Gusto (1 hr): Verify, migrate, cancel

**Critical Path:** W1 → W2 → W3 + W4 parallel → W5 → W6 → W7

**Contract Audit Result (Feb 20, 2026):**
- 14 major technical claims: all verified ✅ exist in codebase
- 3 items spec'd but not built: onboarding portal (spec'd), client portal (parked), NAP scraper (enhancement)
- 4 items need attention: operational process commitments (response SLA, backlink methodology, PPC scope, client comms channel)
- Conclusion: contracts are honest, no capability gaps blocking launch

## 🎯 CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. Reduce Human Friction
**Website builds:** Automate everything possible, minimize client touchpoints
- Don't ask for WordPress credentials
- Don't request style guides they don't have
- Scrape what we need from their site
- Deploy to subdomains to avoid main site complexity

### 2. No Assumptions or Interpretations
**System design:** Remove guessing from humans (sales reps AND Claude)
- System scans client site for style/architecture
- System generates style guide automatically
- System validates choices before human approval
- Clear yes/no decisions, no ambiguity

### 3. Option B Perfection
**Quality:** 10x improvement, not 10%
- Don't port complex systems when simple ones work
- Gregore SENTRY = overkill for GHM
- Build exactly what's needed, nothing more

### 4. Automation > Manual Work
**Scalability:** If done 3x manually → automate
- Website builds: 4 hours with automation vs 3-4 months manual
- Content creation: SCRVNR vs manual writing
- Keyword research: SENTRY vs manual Ahrefs checking

---

## 🔐 CRITICAL TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Database Schema Changes
**Always run migration before deploying:**
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name
npx prisma generate
```

### Vercel Deployment
**Environment variables needed:**
- DATABASE_URL (Neon PostgreSQL)
- DIRECT_URL (Neon direct connection)
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- OUTSCRAPER_API_KEY
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

### File Paths (Immutable)
- SCRVNR: `D:\SCRVNR`
- Gregore: `D:\Projects\Gregore`
- GHM Dashboard: `D:\Work\SEO-Services\ghm-dashboard`
- Ideas: `D:\Projects\Ideas`

---

## 🚨 BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES

### Current Blockers
- None! All decisions made, ready to build

### External Dependencies
- Ahrefs API (for keyword research)
- Outscraper API (for lead enrichment)
- Anthropic API (for SCRVNR content generation)
- Vercel (for deployments)
- GitHub (for repo management)

### Internal Dependencies
- Commission System → Lead Enrichment (wait for Phase 1)
- Website Pipeline → SENTRY (need foundations first)
- Website Pipeline → SCRVNR (need client voice profiling)

---

## 📞 STAKEHOLDERS

### Decision Makers
- **David Kirsch** - Owner, primary developer
- **Gavin Kirsch** - Owner (business operations, no dev work)

### Users
- **Sales Reps** (Arian Germani, future hires)
- **Master Managers** (David, Gavin)
- **Clients** (indirect - website builds, content)

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### From Previous Sessions
1. **Don't over-engineer** - Gregore SENTRY is overkill for GHM
2. **Reduce client friction** - Subdomains avoid credential requests
3. **Automate scraping** - Don't ask for style guides, scrape them
4. **Phased rollouts work** - Commission system in 4 phases = manageable
5. **Specs before code** - Writing comprehensive specs saves time

### Future Sessions Should Know
- Edit Client Details is 95% done (just needs integration)
- Commission system approved with Arian Germani as first rep
- Website automation uses subdomains (NOT WordPress plugins)
- SENTRY for GHM is simple (~250 lines, NOT Gregore port)
- SCRVNR exists and works, just needs client environment

## 🏗️ WEBSITE STUDIO — BUILD STATUS (Added Feb 18, 2026)

### Foundation Complete ✅
All layers built and build passing (exit code 0, zero new TS errors).

**Types:** `src/types/website-studio.ts` — all entities typed (WebProperty, DnaCapture, DnaTokenOverride, BuildJob, ComposerPage, ScrvnrGateResult, matrix types, adapter contract)

**Schema:** 6 Prisma models added, `db push` applied, client regenerated
- WebProperty, DnaCapture, DnaTokenOverride, BuildJob, ComposerPage, ScrvnrGateResult
- `webProperties` relation added to ClientProfile

**DB lib:** `src/lib/db/website-studio.ts`
- getWebPropertyMatrix, getWebProperty, createWebProperty
- getActiveDnaCapture, createDnaCapture, addDnaTokenOverride
- getActiveBuildJob, getAllBuildJobs, createBuildJob, updateBuildJobStage, updateBuildJobPageCounts
- getComposerPages, getComposerPage, createComposerPages, updatePageSections, updatePageScrvnrStatus, updatePageReviewStatus
- recordScrvnrResult, getScrvnrHistory

**API routes:**
- `GET/POST /api/website-studio/[clientId]` — matrix + build queue, scaffold new property
- `POST /api/website-studio/[clientId]/scrvnr` — run SCRVNR gate (Python subprocess)
- `GET/PATCH /api/website-studio/[clientId]/pages/[pageId]` — sections + review status
- `GET/POST/PATCH /api/website-studio/[clientId]/dna` — DNA captures + token overrides

**Python:** `scrvnr/ws_gate_runner.py` — stdin/stdout subprocess bridge to SCRVNR adapter

**UI components** (`src/components/clients/website-studio/`):
- `WebsiteStudioTab.tsx` — orchestrator, matrix/composer view switcher
- `PropertyMatrix.tsx` — tier-colored grid, gap cells, status dots, progress bars
- `BuildQueue.tsx` — active jobs with stage indicators
- `NewPropertyModal.tsx` — 2-step tier selector → config form
- `PageComposer.tsx` — section editor, debounced autosave, inline SCRVNR feedback, gate badge, override prompt

**Profile integration:** "Website Studio" tab added to client profile between Content Studio and Reports.

---

### Website Studio — Remaining Build Items ⏳

**Priority 1 — Deploy Button**
- UI: Button in PageComposer toolbar (enabled when all pages approved)
- Calls Vercel API via existing Vercel MCP or direct REST
- Updates `deployStatus`, `lastDeployedAt`, `vercelProjectId` on WebProperty
- Shows deploy error if Vercel fails

**Priority 2 — Verify `check_section` on adapter**
- `website_studio_adapter.py` needs a `check_section(property_slug, section_name, text, override, override_note)` method
- SCRVNR API route calls it for live single-section debounce checks
- Confirm signature matches or add the method

**Priority 3 — DNA Lab UI**
- API routes exist (`/api/website-studio/[clientId]/dna`)
- DB functions exist
- Need: URL input → scrape → extract → token review panel → save capture
- Override panel: per-token Accept/Override/Recapture/Lock with required note
- Token confidence badges (high/medium/low)

**Priority 4 — Live Sites Panel**
- Status board: all live WebProperties across all clients
- Staleness alerts (lastDeployedAt > threshold)
- SSL expiry warnings
- Basic traffic data column (Vercel analytics or placeholder)

**Priority 5 — PageComposer data fetch efficiency**
- Currently re-fetches the main studio endpoint to find job+pages
- Should have a dedicated `GET /api/website-studio/[clientId]/jobs/[jobId]` route
- Prevents fragile dependency on buildJobs array population

---

## 🐛 BUG BACKLOG & FEATURE REQUESTS (Added Feb 18, 2026)

### Bugs — Fix Priority

**BUG-001: Account type badge doesn't update in My Profile after role change**
- Changing user from sales → master updates DB but badge in profile tab still shows "Sales Rep"
- Needs: global role refresh (likely re-fetch session or invalidate auth cache after role update)
- Affects: all role-based badging, not just profile tab
- Priority: HIGH

**BUG-002: Login page renders incorrectly in dark mode after logout**
- Login page should always be light mode regardless of system preference
- Fix: Force `light` class on login page layout, clear any dark mode cache on auth logout
- Priority: MEDIUM

**BUG-003: Help button misaligned in left nav panel**
- Slightly off-axis vs other nav items (text + icon baseline misalignment)
- Priority: LOW (polish)

**BUG-004: Sales pipeline status badge colors broken in dark mode**
- Available, Scheduled, Contacted, Follow Up, Paperwork colors are unreadable in dark
- Need dark-mode-specific color overrides in LEAD_STATUS_CONFIG or via Tailwind dark: variants
- Priority: MEDIUM

### Features — Build Priority

**FEAT-001: Admin account tier (above Master/Manager)**
- New role: `admin` — sits above current "master" role
- Current "master" → rename to `manager`
- Hierarchy: admin > manager > sales
- Admin = David only (initially), sees everything, all clients, all financials
- Needs: schema enum update, all role checks updated globally, nav + badge coherence

**FEAT-002: Bug report + feature request visibility for Admin**
- Bug reports and feature request submissions currently go nowhere visible
- Build: Admin-only ticket queue (separate from bug tracking used internally)
- Show: ticket type, submitter, date, description, status
- Allow Admin to update ticket status (open → in progress → resolved → closed)
- Notify submitting user of status change (in-app notification or email)
- Priority: HIGH — currently David can't see user-submitted issues

**FEAT-003: My Tasks widget on dashboard, personalized by account type**
- Widget shows tasks relevant to logged-in user's role
- Sales: their assigned leads + follow-up reminders
- Manager: team task overview + overdue items
- Admin: platform-wide queue + any flagged items
- Should respect existing dashboard layout personalization system

## Phase 11: AI Client Layer ✅

**Session:** Feb 2026
**Status:** Complete — TypeScript clean, schema migrated, zero new errors

### Architecture

Extracted and reshaped from GREGORE's orchestration engine. GHM AI layer lives at `src/lib/ai/`.

**Files:**

| File | Origin | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `router/types.ts` | GREGORE types.ts | Extended: GHM domains (seo, copywriting, competitive), GHM intents (website_copy, brief_generation, scrvnr_eval), FeatureContext + CostRecord |
| `router/model-benchmarks.ts` | GREGORE model-benchmarks.ts | Updated model IDs + pricing to current Anthropic API (Feb 2026) |
| `router/complexity-analyzer.ts` | GREGORE complexity-analyzer.ts | GHM domains + intents added to detection; core 4-factor weighted scoring preserved |
| `router/model-router.ts` | GREGORE model-router.ts | Free Energy = Uncertainty × Cost preserved; Tribunal/Parallel strategies removed; returns flat RouterOutput (no Result<T> wrapper) |
| `cost-tracker.ts` | GREGORE metabolism-engine.ts | "Cognitive tokens" abstraction removed; stateless DB writes via Prisma; per-client/per-feature USD analytics |
| `context/system-prompt-builder.ts` | NEW | Feature-specific protocol scaffolding for all 5 AI features |
| `client.ts` | NEW | Unified entry point: routing → prompt assembly → API call → cascade retry → cost logging |
| `index.ts` | NEW | Clean public exports |

**Left behind from GREGORE:** `WorkingSet` (stateful in-memory attention model), `homeostasis/`, `self-model/`, `world/` — GREGORE identity layer, wrong shape for stateless API routes.

### How It Works

Every AI call in the dashboard goes through `callAI()`:
1. Query is classified (complexity + intent + domain via ComplexityAnalyzer)
2. Model router picks optimal model using Free Energy minimization
3. System prompt is assembled for the specific feature + client context
4. Anthropic API is called
5. If `cascade` strategy and response is malformed JSON → auto-escalate to Opus
6. Cost recorded to `AICostLog` table (non-blocking, fire-and-forget)

### Usage Pattern

```typescript
import { callAI } from "@/lib/ai";

const result = await callAI({
  feature: "content_brief",
  prompt: userInstruction,
  context: {
    feature: "content_brief",
    clientId: client.id,
    clientName: client.businessName,
    industry: client.industry,
    taskContext: { title, category, targetKeywords },
  },
});

if (result.ok) {
  const brief = JSON.parse(result.content);
}
```

### Database

New table: `ai_cost_logs` — append-only log of all AI calls.
Fields: feature, clientId, modelId, inputTokens, outputTokens, costUSD, estimatedCostUSD, latencyMs, qualityScore.
Indexed on clientId, feature, timestamp.

### Next Steps for AI Layer

- **Migrate existing content brief API** — replace direct Anthropic call with `callAI()` (10-minute job)
- **Wire Website Studio PageComposer SCRVNR** — already calls `/api/website-studio/[clientId]/scrvnr`; that route needs to use `callAI({ feature: "scrvnr_gate" })`
- **Voice profile injection** — `buildSystemPrompt()` accepts `voiceProfileSlug` but doesn't yet fetch/inject the actual profile tokens; wire to DnaCapture when DNA Lab UI is built
- **Performance history** — `ModelRouter` accepts `ModelPerformance[]` but nothing feeds it yet; once cost logs accumulate, query them and pass in for better routing
- **Admin cost analytics view** — `getCostByClient()` and `getCostByFeature()` are ready; just needs a UI panel
