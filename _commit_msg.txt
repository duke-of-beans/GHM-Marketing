fix: mop-up missed GHM strings from Sprint 28 post-scan

Four files missed by Track A/B/C blueprints:

- src/lib/demo/template.ts: sister file to audit/template.ts, same
  3 GHM strings. Add tenant param, update caller in leads/[id]/demo/route.ts.
- src/app/layout.tsx: root layout (Track B fixed dashboard layout only).
  Static title changed to generic "Dashboard" fallback.
- src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx: alt text in logo fallback branch now
  uses tenantName already in scope from branding fetch.
- src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx: generic "Company logo" alt.
- src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx: generic "Company logo" alt.

Full codebase scan now returns zero GHM runtime strings outside
tenant/config.ts (which holds the tenant data values -- correct).
TypeScript: 5 pre-existing errors only. Zero new errors.
